ANARCHIST 
PRIMARY 
EXPLOSIVES 
MANUAL 


2025-02 


# Intro 


The following are instructions for the manufacture of four primary 
explosives. 

FUCKING AROUND WITH THESE WILL GET YOU AND PEOPLE AROUND YOU KILLED. However, 
it is the author's opinion that the current situation calls for (or may call for 
soon) the use of explosive devices against "Fortress" Europe and the U$A. BUT DO 
NOT FUCK AROUND WITH THEM. TREAT EXPLOSIVES WITH CARE AND CAUTION. 

These four compounds were chosen because they are relatively stable. They are 
not highly shock or friction sensitive but they are sensitive to electricity and 
flame, which is a desirable quality for an explosive, as that makes it safer to 
transport and easier to use. 

If you have explored explosives before you have probably come across the US 
Army Improvised Explosives Manual. The manual is outdated in many ways especially 
the primary substances. A lot of the precursors are no longer easily 
available/available at all. The primary substances are also extremely sensitive and 
dangerous, which often results in accidental detonation and accidental injuries, 
arrests, or deaths. 

Primaries are substances that are easy to detonate. Most explosives, ANFO, 
C4, etc. are not very sensitive. So a primary substance concentrated into a "det 
cap" is often used to initiate the explosion. Because primaries are more easy to 
detonate they can often be quite dangerous as they are more unstable. This guide is 
an attempt to make "safer" (relatively) primaries that will hopefully result in 
less injured, arrested, or dead anarchists. Of course you can still end up dead if 
you fuck around with them so again: please treat these substances with care and 
caution. 

If you buy any chemicals use cash. Buy them weeks to months in advance. Do 
not plan to make a bomb over a weekend. Take your time, refine your method and 
synthesis. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Better to have a successful attack a 
year from now than to have you, or the people around you, arrested, disabled or 
dead tomorrow. A free anarchist is worth more than a martyr. 

Follow similar rules to firearms: Always assume an explosive is ready to 
detonate. Careful where you put it; do not place it anywhere you would regret it 
exploding. Always keep it away from flames, electricity, shock, and friction. Be 
sure of your target and what is around it. 


##How to use this guide 


This guide is arranged into three sections. The primaries section contains 
the recipe for each primary explosive. There are two precursors section. "A" 
precursors can be bought quite easily (or need to be bought because synthesizing 
them is hard). Some can also be synthesized (marked with a *). "B" precursors have 
to be synthesized, as buying them is difficult or leaves quite a paper trail (like 
online purchases from chemical suppliers). Some of the precursors have a colored j 
# # — next to them to identify what explosive they are for. 

These primaries and their processes are available online, you can verify 
information of them on forums and video sites using Tor, or better yet Tails-Tor. 
Look up the methods described to be able to fully understand what you’re doing. 

Some of the information in this guide, like electrolysis, is kept 
purposefully vague as an attempt at a roadblock for people who are not serious or 
will not take adequate precautions. However overall this guide can be followed 
closely and result in explosive substances. 


# Primaries 


Copper hexamine perchlorate 


HH Ingredients 


2.7g copper oxide (powdered) - Precursor A19 

30g 25% ammonia solution - Precursor B1 

1.5g hexamine (powdered) - Precursor B2 

10g ammonium perchlorate (powdered) - Precursor B4.4 


#H## Instructions 


1. Mix powders together. 

2. Prepare ammonia solution, then pour in mixed powders. 

3. Place container holding the mixture into a water bath between 50-60C for 10-20 
minutes. Mix occasionally. 

4. Once the mixture is dark blue stop heating the water bath and let cool until it 
reaches room temperature (20C). 

5. Once cooled remove it from the water bath and put it into the freezer. !!This is 
now an explosive! ! 

6. When the water is light blue remove from freezer and filter the solid. You will 
need a metal filter because a strong acid (Schwartz reagent) is formed. You can use 
vacuum filtration to suck out all the liquid. 

7. Pour the filtered solid into a pan and heat at 30C for 10 minutes to dry the 
crystals. 

8. Put into a seal-able container (plastic tuper works). The results should be 
about 10-11g. 

(Bonus) 9. If you boil the liquid you can get ammonia gas (which you will have to 
pipe into water to keep it) and some unreacted copper oxide, both of which you can 
recycle to make more CHP. 


Potassium chlorate, sulfur, hexamine 


7g potassium chlorate (powdered) - Precursor B4.2 
1.5g sulfur (powdered) - Precursor A1 

1.5g hexamine (powdered) - Precursor B2 

75mL distilled water - Precursor A12 

25mL ethanol - Precursor A8 


1. Heat stainless steel pan to 100C. 

2. While heating mix the three precursor powders with the water and ethanol. 

3. Pour mix onto the heating steel pan. 

4. Heat until the liquid boils off while grinding the powders together until they 
are dry and fine. !!This is now an explosive! ! 

5. Put powder into a seal-able container. 


Isopropyl nickel aminoguanidine diperchlorate 


1g aminoguanidine bicarbonate (powdered) - Precursor B5.3 
0.86g ammonium perchlorate (powdered) - Precursor B4.4 
0.43g nickel carbonate - Precursor A20 

35mL isopropyl alcohol - Precursor A7 


1. Mix powders well at room temperature. 

2. Heat isopropyl alcohol to a boil in a separate container. 

3. Once boiling dump in all reagents. Cover the container to "reflux" the boiling 
mix. If using a magnet stir bar it will mix the solution. Otherwise you will need 
to manually stir by removing the lid. The reaction will go from turquoise to muddy 
to salmon. Reaction time takes 5 minutes. Do not heat above 200C at any point. 

4. Cool until it reaches room temperature. !!This is now an explosive! ! 

5. The solution will need to be filtered by pouring it onto a coffee filter. Get 
rid of the liquid and keep the salmon-colored solid. 

6. Dry the coffee filter and solid (can use a dehydrator, toaster oven, or kitchen 
pan on stove on low). 

7. Once dry remove the solid off the coffee filter and put it into a seal-able 
container. 


Nickel hydrazine nitrate 
!!WARNING!! Hydrazine and nickel nitrate are both carcinogenic and potentially 
lethal. Wear eyewear and a chemical mask when conducting this synthesis. 


H#H## Ingredients 


2.6g nickel oxide - Precursor A18 
6.5g 96% nitric acid - Precursor B6 
30mL hydrazine - Precursor B8 

10mL distilled water - Precursor A12 
1-2g dextrin - Precursor B3 


H### Instructions 


1. Add nickel oxide to a container and then add nitric acid to the same container. 
2. Heat the solution on medium heat until all the nickel oxide is dissolved and 
creates a turquoise-emerald solution. This is a nickel nitrate solution. 

3. Add hydrazine to a second container with the distilled water and the dextrin and 
heat it to 60C. 

4. Slowly pipette and add the nickel nitrate solution into the hydrazine. You will 
see it first form a blue solid that will quickly turn lavender. Keep adding nickel 
nitrate solution until no more lavender solid forms and there is a thin layer of 
the emerald nickel nitrate on top of the purple solid. !!This is now an explosive! ! 
5. Filter off the liquid by pouring the solution onto a coffee filter. Get rid of 
the liquid. 

6. Dry the coffee filter and solid (e.g. can use a dehydrator). 

7. Once dry remove the solid off the coffee filter and put it into a seal-able 
container. 


# Blasting caps 


Blasting caps are necessary for detonating secondary explosives, which are 
made in larger quantities. 

1g of and KSH works for a quite powerful blasting cap. 

0.1g or less is viable for GNAP and {y. 

Place it into a metal cylinder (say an emptied and cleaned bullet casing) and 
tamp 1/4 (by weight) hard pressure, 1/2 bw medium, 1/4 weak. (i.e. 250mg hard, 
500mg medium, 250mg weak for 1g CHP.) Tamp it down with a wooden rod, ideally on 
the end of a lever device. On top of the explosive add 1/4 by weight of smokeless 
or black powder (or until you fill the cylinder). Add a fireworks fuse or an 
electric match into the middle of the black powder/smokeless powder, seal the 
cylinder around the fuse (by crimping the metal) and you have a blasting cap. 

You can buy a fireworks fuse, or make one by making black powder (look it up) 
and coating a string with it. You can also do this with potassium nitrate and sugar 
(look it up). 

You can make an electric match by taking a wire, splitting it (or using two 
wires) and gluing a small piece of steel wool (from a steel wool dish cleaner) to 
each end of the wire, forming a bridge. Coat the exposed wires and piece of steel 
wool in ground up match heads, black powder, or smokeless powder (which you can 
adhere using dextrin - B3). The other end of the wire is then connected to a switch 
and a battery or left unconnected until you touch both ends to either end of a 
battery, generating current and lighting the matchhead. 

Sometimes you will want to guarantee a detonation. In this case do not use a 
bigger blasting cap but multiple blasting caps, as this doubles or triples your 
chance of a successful ignition. If you fail to ignite the size of your blasting 
cap does not matter. 


# Acquire-able Precursors 
## A1 - Sulfur ## 


Sulfur can be bought as a gardening supply though it usually is contaminated 
with bentonite clay. It can be purified by dissolving the mixture in hot toluene or 
xylene - A23 and then cooling it so that sulfur precipitates out. 

It can also be bought from chemical suppliers though this route leaves a big 
paper trail if bought online. 


## A2 - Formaldehyde / Paraformaldehyde 


Formaldehyde solution can be bought as "formalin" at agricultural and 
veterinary stores where it is sold as disinfectant. It can also be bought online. 
Paraformaldehyde can be bought online. 


## A3* - Urea / Carbamide 


Urea can be purchased as fertilizer, usually under the name "carbamide". It's 
fertilizer number is 46-0-0. It is often coated in another substance (sulfur coated 
urea is 36-0-0) and so will need to be dissolved in water and recrystallized (and 
you get sulfur!) 

Urea can be found in non-toxic cold packs (different from ammonium nitrate - 
A4 cold packs). 

Urea can be synthesized from urine. Why you would do that is beyond this 
author but have at it you DIY punk freaks. What would be cooler than blowing up a 
cop with your own piss? 


## A4* - Ammonium Nitrate 

Ammonium nitrate can be found in a relatively pure form in instant cold 
packs. It is the solid spheres in them. 

Ammonium nitrate can be found as fertilizer but quite rarely in 2025. At 
least not in a pure form and recrystallizing it can be a pain. If you ask for 
ammonium nitrate at a hardware store you will likely get odd looks. 

Ammonium nitrate can also be synthesized by nitrating ammonia solution - B1 
with nitric acid - B6. Begin with 25mL of 5% ammonia solution. Add cold nitric acid 
slowly to prevent the reaction from heating up too much. It will fume slightly. Add 
nitric acid until the solution neutralizes at pH7. Heat the solution until 3/4 of 
it evaporates. Cool the solution and crystals will form. Decant (i.e. pour off) the 
excess water and you have ammonium nitrate. 


## A5 - Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda) 


You can buy baking soda at your local grocery store. 


## A6 - Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) 

You can buy sodium hydroxide (lye) at most grocery and hardware stores as a 
drain cleaner. Make sure you get pure lye, as it is often mixed with other things. 
You do not want it to be mixed with aluminum powder, as Al can be quite reactive 
with other compounds especially explosives. 


## A7 - Isopropyl Alcohol ## 


You can buy this at most grocery stores, hardware stores, even convenience 
stores. 


## A8 - Ethanol Alcohol ## 


You can buy this at most grocery stores and hardware stores. 


## A9* - Zinc (powder) / Zinc oxide 


Zinc can be acquired by melting US pennies made after 1982. You will get zinc 
and copper. Destroying coins is illegal but you're reading an explosives manual 
made by an anarchist for anarchists. After melting it you will have to powder it 
which can be done with a lot of grinding. The copper plating can also be used for 
copper oxide - A19. 

Zinc can be found on fencing. A lot of modern chain-link fence on 
construction sites and such is iron coated with zinc for rust protection. Since 
zinc melts relatively low (420C) you could get a bunch of this fencing, put it ina 
furnace and melt the zinc right off. Talk about punk DIY. You can grind the 
resulting metal for the powder. 

Zinc Oxide can be found at pottery stores. When mixing zinc oxide powder and 
carbon powder, and heated at 400C (can be done with a blowtorch) you get zinc 
powder and carbon monoxide. Do this outside. 


## A10* - Ammonium Sulfate 


Ammonium sulfate can be bought as fertilizer for lawns. Its fertilizer number 
is 21-0-0. 
## A11 - Calcium Hydroxide 


Also known as "hydrated lime" or "builders lime" calcium hydroxide can be 
bought as fertilizer or as an additive for concrete and cement. 


## A12 - Distilled water #4 72 


Can be bought in grocery stores, usually for things like ironing. Can also be 
made through distillation of tap water for you DIY hardcore kids. 


## A13 - Silica gel 

Silica gel packets can be found at hobby stores. It's those small packets you 
find in new clothes. 

Silica gel can be found as cat litter, usually mixed with perfume or other 
things that can be manually removed (before your cat pisses in it). 


## A14 - Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach) 


Bleach can be found a lot of places. Make sure you are buying sodium 
hypochlorite bleach, as there are multiple types. You can also buy pool bleach 
which is extra concentrated compared to household cleaning bleach. 


## A15 - Sodium Chloride (table salt) 


Sodium chloride can be bought a lot of places. 


## A16 - Potassium Chloride 

Potassium chloride can be bought as table salt "lite" at many grocery stores 
(though you may have to go to bougee ones to find pure potassium chloride as a lot 
of it is mixed half and half with sodium chloride) and as a water softener salt at 
hardware stores (in bulk quantities). 


## A17 - Corn starch 


Grocery store! (Also called corn flour in Europe.) 


## A18 - Nickel Oxide [7 


Nickel oxide can be found at ceramic stores. 


## A19* - Copper Oxide [i 


Copper oxide can be found at ceramic stores. 

Copper oxide can also be made by electrolysis of copper metal. Prepare a 
salt-water solution. Add a cathode and anode of copper and connect a car battery 
charger to each side (or your preferred power source). Turn on the power supply and 
immediately you will see hydrogen being produced. The copper anode will slowly 
"melt" away creating copper hydroxide (as well as copper oxide). After four to five 
hours turn off the power and let the solid in the salt water settle. Filter the 
solution with a coffee filter. Keep the brown solid (that is copper hydroxide and 
some copper oxide). Dry out the filter paper and copper oxide. Transfer the dry 
powder into a crucible and using a small butane torch or lighter you can oxidize 
the copper hydroxide by simply burning it with the open flame. You will have a 
black powder that is copper oxide. 


## A20 - Nickel Carbonate ## 


Nickel carbonate can be found at ceramic stores. 


## A21 - Gelatin 


Sorry vegans! Gelatin can be found at grocery stores and food hobby stores. 


## A22 - Toluene / Xylene 


Both of these are common solvents available at hardware stores. Toluene can 
be bought as paint thinner, usually mixed with other liquids. It can also be found 
in shoe repair shops. Xylene is also bought as paint thinner, usually mixed with 
some other liquids. Neither of the impurities should matter much for separating out 
sulfur from bentonite clay. 


## A23 - Potassium Nitrate 


Potassium nitrate is easily available as stump remover. 
It can be synthesized from hard wood ash, but why? 


## A24 - Epsom bath salts (magnesium sulfate) 


Epsom salts are available at many pharmacies, department and grocery stores. 


## A25 - Calcium hypochlorite (pool bleach) 
Pool bleach can be found in solid tablets or liquid form, though the solid is 
preferred. 


## A26 - Hydrochloric acid 


Hydrochloric acid is easily available as "muriatic acid" used for concrete. 
It can be used without purifying or purified in the following method: Fill a 
container with 100mL muriatic acid and another with 100mL distilled water - A12. 
Leave both uncovered but place them into a larger covered container. Seal the 
container and then leave for a day or four. The hydrochloric acid will travel 
through chemistry magic from the muriatic mix into the distilled water until it 
achieves equilibrium. 


## A27 - Acetone 


Can easily be bought at a hardware store. The ACE brand is known for being 
very pure, although to be quite honest you don't really need to purify it (fuck you 
real scientists). It usually has a couple of additives that can fuck with 
chemistry, but unless you're making something to ingest it should be fine (do not 
eat anything you make in this guide what the fuck). 


# Synthesized Precursors 
## B1 - Ammonia solution 77; 


Ammonia solution can be bought, but it is in too low of a concentration (3- 
10%) and these reaction needs 25% solution (or more). Concentrating it is possible. 
Place the ammonia solution into a container that can be heated and that has two 
outputs (you can modify any container that has a lid by drilling two holes into the 
lid). One output will have an aquarium pump pumping air in, the other will lead the 
ammonia gas out. Place the output end (e.g. end of a tube) into container that has 
water. Make sure that the end of your tube is at the bottom of the water. Heat the 
container with the less concentrated ammonia solution. Do not boil the water or 
your solution will be less concentrated. If your container cannot handle direct 
heat (e.g. a mason jar or plastic container) a hot water bath is fine. The ammonia 
will boil off and concentrate into the water. For better yields place the receiving 
water in an ice water bath, and seal the receiving container so that ammonia does 
not evaporate off. To be successful in your concentration you have to make sure 
that the ratios are correct. If you have 10% ammonia solution and you want to 
concentrate it to 20% then you will need 200mL of the store-bought solution and 
100mL of distilled water - A12 in the receiving container, etc. 

Ammonia can also be made through mixing chemicals: ammonium sulfate - A10 and 
calcium hydroxide - A11 are mixed in distilled water - A12 they form a solution of 
ammonia and calcium sulfate. Weight the ammonium sulfate and calcium hydroxide out 
in a 1:1 molar ratio. If you cannot figure out what a mole is put this guide away. 
By copying the setup above you can boil off the ammonia and water and collect it in 
a new beaker. This will yield quite concentrated ammonia, up to 30%. A difference 
from the first solution however is that you do want to boil the ammonia and calcium 
sulfate solution so as to collect all the water. Distillation equipment, or 
improvised distillation equipment, is a must for this. 


## B2 - Hexamine [2 ## 


Hexamine can be bought as emergency fuel solid tablets at camping stores. 
However, they are not always easy to find. They are more easily available online 
but this leaves a large paper trail. If you manage to buy them you will have to 
dissolve them in water to remove the wax and paper coverings and recrystallize the 
hexamine by cooling the solution and filtering it. 

Hexamine can also be made by reacting ammonia solution - B1 with 
formaldehyde/paraformaldehyde - A2. 

When using paraformaldehyde weigh out 180g and add 300g of ammonia solution. 
You want an excess of ammonia to react with all the paraformaldehyde because 
ammonia is stinkier but easier to get rid of when unreacted. The mixture will heat 
up. Let it cool to room temperature before boiling and stirring until all the 
paraformaldehyde is dissolved. Boil it for about ten minutes longer to ensure all 
the paraformaldehyde has reacted. Pour it into a tray to let the ammonia and water 
evaporate while the mixture cools. Hexamine will crystallize and remain. 

When using formaldehyde you can use 30mL of 37% formaldehyde solution and 
50+mL of 25% ammonia solution. You will know there is more ammonia than 
formaldehyde if you are able to stand far away and smell the ammonia (which means 
it is in excess). Always ensure ammonia is in excess for making hexamine. Once the 
mixture of the liquids cools then you can boil off the excess water until it 
appears cloudy. From there let it cool again and then put into a tray to let the 
rest of the water and ammonia evaporate. 


## B3 - Dextrin 7 


Dextrin can be made very easily. Pour out corn starch - A17 onto baking paper 
on a baking tray. Any amount will do. Bake it at 230C for a few hours. It will 
change color from pure white to a brownish yellowish powder. Mix it every half hour 
to get an even bake. Once it is golden-ish, about 5 hours in if you use an entire 
container of corn starch, you have dextrin. 


## B4.1 - Sodium Chlorate 


There are three ways to make sodium chlorate. The first is from sodium 
hypochlorite - A14 through thermal decomposition (i.e. heating). The second is from 
calcium hypochlorite - A25 also through thermal decomposition. The third is through 
electrolysis of sodium chloride - A15. 

Note: sodium chlorate is extremely hygroscopic (will absorb water moisture 
from air). It must be kept sealed in an airtight container and if stored for too 
long might have to be dissolved in water and recrystallized. 

For the first method you will need a heat source, a battery hydrometer, a 
large glass or metal container. Weight out one gallon (3.785L) of sodium 
hypochlorite (bleach) - A14 into the container and begin to heat it. Bring it toa 
boil. When the hydrometer reads 1.3 (or in the case of a battery hydrometer it will 
read "full charge") remove it from the heat source and cool it to between room 
temperature and OC. Filter out the crystals and repeat the boiling and cooling 
process three times total. This will be sodium chlorate. You can add these crystals 
to distilled water - A12 until they are fully dissolved by mixing, boil the 
solution and allow it to cool again. Pure sodium chlorate will slowly precipitate 
out of the solution as it is cooled in a fridge and the heating will have destroyed 
any remaining bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Filter and dry the crystals and store 
them in a sealed container. 

The second method is very similar to the first. Weight out a 1200g of solid 
calcium hypochlorite (pool bleach) - A25 into a glass or metal container. Add 159g 
of sodium chloride (table salt) - A15. Add enough boiling distilled water - A12 to 
fully dissolve both powders. Heat the solution to maintain it boiling. A white 
substance will form (calcium chloride). Pour the still-hot solution through a 
filter and keep the liquid. Boil the water to evaporate it off and you will be left 
with sodium chlorate crystals. 

The third method is electrolysis. There are so many ways to make electrolysis 
cells (look them up online) but the easiest are to find graphite or pressed 
charcoal anodes (positive) and steel plate cathodes (negative). You want a medium 
plastic container with a seal-able lid. The cathode and anode go through the lid 
(seal it with hot glue and epoxy), and also run a tube from the lid into a separate 
container filled with water (tap water will do). The purpose of this tube is to 
catch the chlorine and hydrogen gasses produced and put them into water so that 
they do not a- poison you or b-explode. Place the cathode and anode relatively 
close together (a few centimeters apart) to create higher temperature. The ideal 
temperature is 56C. If it gets too hot turn the power off and let it cool. If it 
gets too cold either wrap the cell in aluminum foil or increase the current. Place 
454g of sodium chloride - A1i5 into 4L of distilled water - A1*. You can add 33g of 
hydrochloric acid - A26 (whether as muriatic or in the purified form) or the 
equivalent of sulfuric acid - B7. Turn on the power, 3-4 volts, and wait. After 
some hours the liquid is removed from the cell and boiled until crystals form then 
cooled so more sodium chlorate precipitates. Filter out the crystals then repeat 
the boiling and cooling two more times. Keep the remaining liquid each time. After 


this boiling and cooling add the liquid back into the cell with a fresh batch of 
salt water solution as detailed earlier. The crystals are sodium chlorate. Measure 
and record them and keep an eye on your yield. Electrolysis is a bit of a shit show 
and dark magic. Different tweaks can vastly increase your output. Tweak the 
temperature, the current, the spacing of the electrodes, the amount of acid, etc. 


## B4.2 - Potassium Chlorate ## 


Potassium chlorate can be prepared in four different ways. 

The first three ways are the same as sodium chlorate - B4.1. Here are the 
differences: 

For the first method (boiling sodium hypochlorite - A14* conduct the same 
procedure but add 63g of potassium chloride - A16 to the solution. The crystals 
that precipitate will be potassium chlorate. 

For the second method (boiling calcium hypochlorite - A25) instead of the 
sodium chloride add 220g of potassium chloride - A16. However, after boiling the 
solution and filtering it (while still hot) to remove the calcium chloride, you do 
not need to boil it. Simply cooling will precipitate out the potassium chlorate, 
which can then be filtered out. Keep the solid crystals and discard the water. 

For the third method, electrolysis, you make the same shit except you use 
potassium chloride - A16 in the salt water solution instead of sodium chloride. The 
amount that dissolves into 4L of water will be different, and you will likely also 
have to fuck around with the temperature, current, spacing of electrodes, acid, 
etc. Electrolysis is cool and can be quite efficient but is a shit show in terms of 
adjustments. Look up guides online there are thousands. 

The fourth method of making potassium chlorate is a simple ion-substitution 
reaction. Sodium chlorate - B4.1 is more soluble in water than potassium chlorate 
(our target). Create a solution of sodium chlorate (i.e. mix the sodium chlorate 
with distilled water - A12 until all the crystals disappear). Then add potassium 
chloride - A16 slowly. As you cool this mixture potassium chlorate should 
precipitate out, leaving you with potassium chlorate solid at the bottom and a 
mixture of sodium chloride and sodium chlorate in the water. Filter the water off 
and keep the solid. Dry it and store it in a container. 


## B4.3 - Sodium Perchlorate 


Sodium perchlorate can be made through two methods: electrolysis and thermal 
decomposition. For the quantities required in this guide thermal decomposition is 
probably preferable. If you want to make a lot of perchlorates go the electrolysis 
route. 

Electrolysis perchlorate cells are a lot less sensitive than chlorate cells. 
The pH and temperature are a lot less specific and the main difference is in the 
anode/cathode (electrodes) materials. The cathode can continue to be steel. The 
anode on the other hand should be platinum (expensive) or lead dioxide (you have to 
DIY it) (this is not a lead dioxide anode guide, figure it out). You can make 
sodium perchlorate from sodium chloride - A15. No special need is needed from this 
just make a salt water solution with a little acid and pop it into your steel 
cathode and titanium/lead dioxide anode cell. You can also make sodium perchlorate 
using sodium chlorate - B4.1. For this you will need 60g of sodium chlorate for 
every 100mL of distilled water - A12. Use a higher current for your perchlorate 
cell, about 5-7 volts. A higher current will increase the speed of the reaction but 
will also increase the wear on your anode. After a few hours filter out the solid 
from the water. You can reuse the water in your cell with new solution to top it 
off. Dry this and store it in an airtight container. 


The thermal decomposition method of making sodium perchlorate is easier 
though it provides less yields. Take your sodium chlorate - B4.1 and place it ina 
ceramic crucible. Place the ceramic crucible inside a carved out fire brick that 
has a hole for adding heat in. Heat it to 300-500C. You will likely need a butane 
torch or electric heat gun. Cover the crucible with either a crucible lid or 
aluminum foil. After 1-3 hours a slurry will remain, which is a mix of sodium 
chloride, sodium chlorate, and sodium perchlorate. Once it stops bubbling prepare a 
container with acetone - A27. Pour the slurry into the acetone and mix it well. 
Place the container with the solution into a hot water bath to ensure all the 
perchlorate dissolves into the acetone. Cool it down to room temp and then filter 
off the solids (which are chlorate and chloride and you can discard it or put it 
back into an electrolysis cell). Take the solution of sodium perchlorate and 
acetone and put it into a pan to boil off the acetone (do this in a well ventilated 
area to avoid breathing in fumes). The remaining powder is sodium perchlorate. 
Store it in an airtight container. 

!!WARNING!! For both methods you have to destroy the remaining chlorate, 
especially since the main reason this guide is making sodium perchlorate is to make 
ammonium perchlorate - B4.4, and if you accidentally make ammonium chlorate you 
will have a bad time. 

You can destroy the remaining chlorate through the following process: 
dissolve your sodium perchlorate mixture into distilled water - A12. You will need 
quite a bit of water. (You can also do this before you filter off the solid from 
the water after running your electrolysis cell.) To the solution add hydrochloric 
acid - A26 (either purified or store grade). Add it slowly using a dropper and boil 
the solution. This will generate a yellow gas, chlorine dioxide. !!WARNING!! 
Chlorine dioxide is toxic. Do this outside or in an extremely well ventilated area. 
The chlorine dioxide will evaporate and some will stay in solution giving the 
liquid a yellow color to it. After boiling for 15 minutes no more gas should 
generate when adding drops of acid. Remove from heat and add sodium hydroxide - A6 
until the solution becomes clear/colorless again. It is better to have a basic 
solution than an acidic solution. You can add some sodium bicarbonate - A5 to 
ensure there is no acid left. If it fizzes there is acid. Add and mix well until 
there is no more fizzing. Cool the solution so the sodium perchlorate precipitates 
out and then filter it off, discarding the liquid and keeping the solid. Store it 
in an airtight container. 


## B4.4 - Ammonium Perchlorate [7 ## 


Ammonium perchlorate can be made via one method with two different reagents 
reacting with sodium perchlorate - B4.3. The two ammonium reagents are ammonium 
sulfate - A10 and ammonium nitrate - A4. 

When mixing sodium perchlorate - B4.3 and ammonium nitrate - A4 use the 
following method: Take 122.5g of sodium perchlorate and dissolve it in 150mL of 
distilled water - A12. Heat the solution to 80C. Add 80g of ammonium nitrate. Mix 
until both are dissolved while keeping the heat at 80C. Slowly cool the mixture to 
room temperature. Ammonium perchlorate will crystallize out. Filter that out and 
discard the liquid. Dry the crystals and store in an airtight container. 

When mixing sodium perchlorate - B4.3* and ammonium sulfate - A10 use the 
following method: For every 100mL of distilled water dissolve 61.26g of sodium 
perchlorate and 33g of ammonium sulfate at 80C. Once they are dissolved begin 
cooling. Sodium sulfate will precipitate out in a solid filter it out while the 
water is still warm and keep the liquid. Heat to 80C again and then cool quickly to 
room temperature. You should get ammonium perchlorate crystals. Filter off the 


liquid and keep the solid. Dry the crystals and store in an airtight container. 

You can, and probably should, dissolve the ammonium perchlorate in water, 
boil the solution and add muriatic acid to destroy any possible ammonium chlorate. 
Then neutralize the solution the same way that was done with the sodium 
perchlorate. 


## B5.1 - Guanidine nitrate 


Guanidine nitrate can be prepared through the following method: a 2L 
stainless steel is placed in a hot oil bath heated by a hotplate. Place 340g of 
ammonium nitrate - A4, 200g urea - A3, and 80g of silica gel - A13 into the 
stainless steel reactor container. Heat the oil bath to 195C. The mixture will melt 
and must be stirred for a total of 2 hours. Add another 150g of urea and stir until 
it dissolves. Then let it sit for 2.5-3 hours at the 195C. After that time cool it 
to room temperature and remove it from the oil bath. Transfer it to a separate 
container that has 250mL of distilled water - A12. Boil the mixture and filter it 
while hot to filter out the silica gel. Wash the silica gel and filter with 150mL 
of boiling hot water. Collect all the water (guanidine nitrate solution) which has 
passed through the filter. Cool the solution to OC which will precipitate out the 
guanidine nitrate. Filter off the water and collect the solid then put the solid 
into more water, boil it and cool it again to recrystallize it. Filter and dry. The 
yield should be 190-210g. 


## B5.2 - Nitroguanidine 


!!Warning!! Nitroguanidine is an explosive. It is a secondary explosive but 
should still be treated with care and caution. Do not heat it above 150C. 

300g of sulfuric acid - B7 is placed in a container inside an ice water bath. 
A salt ice water bath would be even better as you want this reaction to be quite 
cold. 100g of guanidine nitrate - B5.1 is added, as well as 29g of ammonium nitrate 
- A4. The reaction will heat up so you want to add the ingredients slowly and keep 
refilling the salt-ice. Pre-cooling your ingredients in the fridge (for the acid) 
and freezer (for the solids) also helps. This will decrease danger and massively 
increase yields. Mix the ingredients that are reacting for 60 minutes. Keep it as 
close as possible to OC, though up to 20C is okay. After an hour take the solution 
and pour into 1L of cold water with ice cubes (tap water is fine here). This will 
precipitate out the nitroguanidine. !!You now have an explosive!! Let the ice melt 
(the water will rise to room temperature) and then filter out the solid crystals. 
Take the solid crystals and put them into boiling water. Wait until it completely 
dissolves. Add more water if it does not all dissolve. The liquid should be totally 
clear. Then take it off heat and let it cool to room temperature. The nitro- 
guanidine will recrystallize as the water cools. Filter off the water and keep the 
solid. Dry it and store it in an airtight container. 


## B5.3 - Aminoguanidine bicarbonate 

!!Warning!! Nitroguanidine is an explosive. 

Aminoguanidine bicarbonate requires the following ingredients: 41.14g zinc 
powder - A9, 47.62g ammonium sulfate - A10 in 285mL distilled water - A12, 20g 
nitroguanidine - B5.1, 8.57g of 25% ammonia solution - B1, and 28.57g sodium 
bicarbonate - A5. 

The instructions are as follows: weigh out your zine powder and place it to 
the side. Place a reaction flask into an ice bath. Mix in the ammonium sulfate in 
water and the nitroguanidine. Stir the solution; not everything will dissolve. 
Place a thermometer and keep stirring. Once the solution reaches 10C begin adding 
small amounts of zinc powder. Monitor the heat and don't add too much at once. If 


needed refill the ice bath. Keep the temperature between 5-15C, leaning towards the 
higher end to help the reaction. The addition of all the zinc should take about an 
hour. After keep stirring for about 30 minutes at 15C. Using a vacuum filter remove 
the zinc-oxide sludge and keep the liquid which should be yellow in color. Add the 
ammonia solution and the sodium bicarbonate while stirring until all the solids are 
dissolved. Stop stirring and let the solution stand for 12 hours. The 
aminoguanidine bicarbonate will slowly precipitate. Vacuum filter the solid to 
remove the liquid and keep the solid. Air dry the solid and store into an airtight 
container. The results should be 15.7g. 


## B6 - Nitric Acid [Zz 

There are two synthesis for nitric acid. The first requires sulfuric acid - 
B7 and potassium nitrate - A23. The second is an electric method. 

For the first method weight out 330g of potassium nitrate, 160mL of sulfuric 
acid, and 80mL of distilled water - A12. Create a simple distillation apparatus. 
Have a large bucket of water nearby. Mix the potassium nitrate into the sulfuric 
acid and water and seal all your joints in your glassware with sulfuric acid (pour 
small quantities into the joints). This stops the nitric acid fumes from escaping 
since they are quite poisonous and corrosive. Place the solution into the heat end 
of the distillation and add heat until the solution starts to lightly bubble. Run 
the distillation for 2-3 hours and collect the resulting liquid. This is nitric 
acid. !!Warning!! If at any point it begins to boil over dump it into your bucket 
of water. 

The second method requires a somewhat complex setup of electricity called the 
Birkeland-Eyde process. It uses an electrical arc to create pyrolyzed air which 
turns into nitrogen dioxide and which is then bubbled into water which makes nitric 
acid. You will need glassware for this reaction, plastic will not play well with 
the electricity. You will need an opening for air input, one for gas output, and a 
way to run current in. The metal cathode and anode are kept separate enough that an 
electrical current will form an arc of plasma between them. A copper spark gap will 
work. Using 35-40 watts is the ideal power input. Using an air pump will pump air 
into the glass container where the reaction happens. This will generate a red gas, 
which will continue to be pumped through the output tube. The gas dispersion tube 
needs to be at the bottom of the distilled water - A1i2 to ensure that all of it 
goes into the water and forms nitric acid. This process will need multiple days to 
run. 


## B7 - Sulfuric Acid 


Sulfuric acid can be bought as drain cleaner in relatively pure forms (except 
for some dye which should not affect most processes, but you can still runa 
purification if you want to). It can also be bought as battery acid in car stores, 
though it is quite expensive in this form. 

However, sulfuric acid is often tracked quite extensively as it is a common 
precursor (and a weapon in itself). So there is a way to synthesize it using 
Magnesium sulfate - A24 and electrolyzing it with a lead dioxide/carbon (graphite) 
electrode (either works) and a copper electrode. You need a glass baking dish and a 
unglazed clay pot with no hole in it. Weight out 246g of the magnesium sulfate. 
Place it the glass dish. Place the clay pot into the glass dish removed from the 
magnesium sulfate. Fill both the clay pot and the glass dish with distilled water - 
A12, at minimum 1L so that the salt is dissolved. Make sure that the copper 
electrode is clean and use it to stir the magnesium sulfate to dissolve most (but 
not all) into the water. Place the copper electrode into the glass dish with a part 


extending out. This is your cathode (negative) end of the current. Place your lead 
dioxide/carbon (graphite) electrode into the clay pot that is holding only water. 
This is your anode (positive) electrode. Connect your cathode and anode to a 12-24V 
electric output. The sulfuric acid will be generated at the anode inside the clay 
pot. The outside solution will turn from magnesium sulfate to magnesium hydroxide. 
The water in the clay pot will also decrease through osmosis as it tries to head 
towards the salt, keep filling the clay pot with distilled water. Stir occasionally 
to continue dissolving the magnesium sulfate (magnesium hydroxide will not be 
soluble and will form a solid layer at the bottom). After ~72 hours the solution in 
the clay pot will be sulfuric acid (with some of the material from the anode if you 
used carbon graphite) (and it will likely look pink from clay particles). Decant 
the liquid (and filter off the solid material). You can concentrate it further by 
boiling the liquid until you see white fumes (or until it reaches 337C which 
requires boiling off most of the water). This will give you 98% sulfuric acid. From 
246g of magnesium sulfate ideal output would be 54.4mL. Place it in a seal-able 
container. 


## B8 - Hydrazine solution 77; 


!!WARNING!! Hydrazine is extremely poisonous. If you can smell ammonia you 
are fucked. Wear full facial protection (eyes, nose, mouth) when making or using 
hydrazine. Ventilate your work space extremely well, and avoid any exposure to 
animals or humans. !!WARNING!! 

Synthesis: 32g of sodium hydroxide - A6 (lye) is added to 150mL of distilled 
water - A12. This will create heat. Let it cool. Then add 26g of 10-12% sodium 
hypochlorite - A14 to a separate beaker (note that this reaction uses "pool bleach" 
not household cleaning bleach). Chill both solutions in ice baths. Then add the lye 
solution to the bleach. Separately measure out 1g of gelatin - A21 and 22g of urea 
- A3, and mix with 100mL of distilled water - A12. Heat and stir the bleach/lye 
solution and add the gelatin/urea solution. Heat at 85C and stir it. !!Warning: 
there is now hydrazine in solution and some will evaporate, this is where the 
danger really begins!! The majority of the bubbles will be carbon dioxide leaving 
the solution. Heat and stir for 20 minutes while most of the C02 dissolves and 
leaves the solution. Transfer to an airtight seal-able container. (In fact put that 
container into another airtight seal-able container just to be safe that you're not 
leaking hydrazine anywhere. )
